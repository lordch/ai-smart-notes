- ## Executive Summary
	- Claims “ChatGPT 5.2” signals a shift from 2025’s *execution with models* to 2026’s *delegation to models*: long-running, agentic work that can chew through large, messy inputs and return finished artifacts.
	- What’s new (claimed): agentic-by-default workflows that can run 20–40 minutes, process very large datasets (example: 10k rows), and output usable PowerPoint / doc / Excel with better coherence and fewer hallucinations.
	- Primary bottleneck: not model capability, but human delegation skill: defining the work, specifying outputs, describing inputs, and framing the problem correctly (stakes rise because feedback loops are slower).
	- Comparisons: Gemini 3 is framed as having poor ergonomics for large-artifact workflows; Claude Opus 4.5 is framed as strong on artifacts, with differences described as tools-based execution vs 5.2 “thinking mode” long-running reasoning.
	- Practical takeaway: learn to package work into a clear scope + output spec + input description, then let the model run—while still validating outputs.

- ## Relation to My Framework
	- **Reinforces**: [[The Supervision Split]] — the “bottleneck is delegation skill” is the user-supervised pattern: autonomy increases only as supervision becomes cheaper and more reliable.
	- **Reinforces**: [[Integrated Environment Principle]] — longer-running agents raise the cost of misframing; the fix is tighter inspection loops via visible, editable artifacts.
	- **Reinforces**: [[Agentic UX — The Dual Interface Requirement]] — the artifact surface (PPT/doc/Excel) is where collaboration and supervision actually happen; chat is steering, not the work product.
	- **Connects to**: [[Meeting Users Where They Are]] — “don’t force everything to text”: the value is outputs in native formats (slides/spreadsheets/docs) that land where work already lives.
	- **Connects to**: [[Working Memory vs Long-Term Memory]] — mid-work artifacts externalize progress, create stable baselines, and make long-running work survivable across checkpoints/sessions.
	- **Connects to**: [[The Autonomy Slider]] — as context quality improves, you can safely delegate longer blocks of work; long-run capability makes investing in context/inspection higher leverage.
	- **Connects to**: [[Agent Amnesia and the Continuity Problem]] — artifacts + externalized procedures are how delegation compounds instead of resetting each session.
	- **Tension to watch**: [[Resist premature artifact production]] — artifacts are essential, but the sequence matters (research → plan → intermediate artifacts → final artifacts).

- ## Extracted Concepts / Follow-ups
	- → [[Middle artifacts as collaboration checkpoints]]
	- → [[Integrated Environment Principle]]
	- → [[Agentic UX — The Dual Interface Requirement]]
	- → [[Meeting Users Where They Are]]
	- → Potential: delegation template note (“scope + output spec + input description + validation checklist”)
