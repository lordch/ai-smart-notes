- # Literature Review: Knowledge Management Field (2020–2025)
- **The Knowledge Management field is experiencing a significant inflection point as generative AI forces reconsideration of foundational assumptions about knowledge capture, transfer, and creation.** This review surveys current research themes, theoretical developments, empirical findings, and emerging debates.
- ---
- ## 1. Field Overview and Evolution
	- ### The Post-Disillusionment Maturation
		- KM emerged in the early 1990s, peaked in hype around 2000, and entered a "trough of disillusionment" as technology-centric initiatives failed to deliver promised value. The 2010s saw quieter maturation toward practice-based, socially-situated approaches.
		- The 2020s represent a **new inflection point**: generative AI reopens questions that seemed settled, particularly around:
			- Whether tacit knowledge can be "captured" computationally
			- The role of human judgment in knowledge processes
			- Automation vs. augmentation of knowledge work
	- ### Publication and Research Activity
		- Bibliometric analyses show steady growth in KM publications across domains:
		- **Construction sector**: Publications peaked in 2024, reflecting growing recognition of KM for complex project management (IJRISS, 2025)
		- **Digital platforms**: Kan et al. (2025) traced evolution from 2004–2024, showing thematic shift toward platform economies
		- **AI integration**: AlMuzaini et al. (2025) analyzed 42 articles specifically on KM–AI intersection, indicating this as the dominant emerging theme
- ---
- ## 2. The AI Integration Wave
	- ### Systematic Review Findings
		- AlMuzaini et al. (2025) conducted the most comprehensive systematic review of AI in KM, identifying **five core themes**:
		- | Theme | Key Questions |
		  |-------|---------------|
		  | AI–Human Collaboration | How can AI augment human capabilities in knowledge processes? |
		  | Trust and Ethics | What are reliability and ethical implications of AI in KM? |
		  | Ingenuity | How does AI foster innovation within KM practices? |
		  | Organizational Performance | What impact does AI-enhanced KM have on effectiveness? |
		  | Information Security | How do we protect knowledge assets in AI systems? |
		- **Key finding**: Integration is still in early stages — research is fragmented, applications are evolving, and significant gaps remain.
	- ### Generative AI Specifically
		- Pimentel and Veliz (2025) explored GenAI's potential for KM:
			- **Opportunities**: Automating content creation, synthesizing information, improving decision-making
			- **Limitations**: Integration remains fragmented; no consolidated research agenda exists
			- **Call to action**: Need for roadmaps integrating GenAI into KM practice
		- The "fragmentation" finding is significant — despite commercial hype, academic understanding of how GenAI changes KM is underdeveloped.
- ---
- ## 3. Theoretical Extensions: SECI in the AI Age
	- ### HAC-SECI Model (Matsumoto, Nishikawa, Morimoto 2025)
		- The **Human-AI-Collaboration SECI Model** proposes a dual-loop structure:
		- **Inner loop (Agent Growth Loop)**: Humans provide knowledge to LLM-based agents
		- **Outer loop (Target Development Loop)**: AI helps humans recognize their own knowledge through digital twin interactions
		- This positions AI not just as knowledge repository but as **active participant in the knowledge spiral**.
	- ### GRAI Framework (Böhm & Durst 2025)
		- The **Generative, Receptive AI Framework** (*VINE Journal of Information and Knowledge Management Systems*) represents the most comprehensive SECI extension:
		- Splits each SECI quadrant into human and machine perspectives, creating **eight fields of action**
		- Positions machines as either:
			- **Active** (generating output)
			- **Passive** (listening and adapting internal representations)
		- **Key finding on externalization**: GenAI can assist by creating visual representations and conceptual models capturing tacit knowledge structure
		- **Key limitation**: AI "still fails to provide concise explanations or references unlike symbolic KM systems"
	- ### Empirical Evidence: ChatGPT and SECI (Heliyon, 2025)
		- Study of ChatGPT integration with SECI in educational settings:
		- | SECI Phase | With ChatGPT | Without ChatGPT |
		  |------------|--------------|-----------------|
		  | Externalization | 64% "excellent" | 15% "excellent" |
		  | Combination | Limited impact | — |
		  | Internalization | 41.3% predictive | 63.4% predictive |
		- **Critical insight**: AI excels at early externalization (idea generation, mind mapping) but **decreases** internalization effectiveness.
		- This asymmetry has profound implications: AI accelerates articulation but may impede deep understanding.

- ## 4. Digital Transformation Context
	- ### SMEs and Knowledge Management
		- Hafeez et al. (2025) systematic review on KM in digitally transforming SMEs:
		- **Findings**:
			- Digital tools reshape how knowledge is created, shared, utilized
			- SMEs need adaptive KM strategies for digital technologies
			- Resource constraints and cultural resistance remain barriers
		- **Gap identified**: Need for frameworks guiding SMEs through KM–digital transformation intersection
	- ### Platform Economies
		- Kan et al. (2025) bibliometric analysis of digital platform KM (2004–2024):
		- Thematic evolution from document management → social knowledge → platform ecosystems
		- Need to understand KM's role in platform economies where knowledge is distributed, dynamic, and co-created
- ---
- ## 5. Sector-Specific Developments
	- ### Agriculture
		- Tumwebaze et al. (2025) systematic review of KM in agricultural research:
		- **Unique factors affecting agricultural KM**:
			- Stakeholder heterogeneity (farmers, researchers, policymakers)
			- Informality of contexts
			- Presence of indigenous knowledge systems
		- Calls for **nuanced frameworks** acknowledging non-Western knowledge traditions
	- ### Aerospace Engineering
		- Wittenborg et al. (2025) systematic review:
		- Emphasis on **semantic-based approaches** for managing engineering knowledge
		- Need for structured ontologies to capture design rationale
		- Integration challenge: connecting tacit design expertise with formal knowledge bases
	- ### Construction
		- Growing recognition of KM for project risk management
		- Peak publications in 2024 reflect industry adoption
		- Focus on knowledge sharing across project phases and organizational boundaries
	- ### Education
		- Amelia et al. (2024) systematic review of KM in Indonesian education:
		- KM practices more prevalent in secondary/tertiary than basic education
		- Success factors: infrastructure, student participation, educator support, collaborative culture
- ---
- ## 6. Persistent Challenges and Debates
	- ### The Tacit Knowledge Problem
		- Despite decades of research, the core challenge remains: **deeply tacit knowledge resists externalization**.
		- Grimen's "Strong Thesis" — some knowledge is in principle verbally unarticulatable — persists as a limit case.
		- AI does not resolve this; it may obscure it by creating illusion of capture when only surface articulation occurs.
	- ### Technology vs. Practice Tension
		- The first-generation mistake (KM = databases) keeps recurring in new forms:
			- 1990s: "Put it in the intranet"
			- 2010s: "Put it in the wiki"
			- 2020s: "Put it in the RAG system"
		- Each technological wave promises to solve the knowledge capture problem; each eventually confronts the same limits.
		- Second-generation insight remains valid: **knowledge is enacted, not stored**.
	- ### Cultural Transferability
		- SECI model emerged from Japanese corporate culture (lifetime employment, collectivism, "giri")
		- Glisby and Holden (2003) critique — still relevant — questions universal applicability
		- Recent sector-specific reviews (agriculture, construction) implicitly acknowledge this by calling for context-specific frameworks
	- ### Empirical Validation Gap
		- Farnese et al. (2019): Despite wide diffusion, "theoretical development has not always been accompanied by sound methodologies"
		- Gourlay's critique (2003, 2006): SECI may be "Theory of Semantic Information" rather than knowledge creation
		- The field struggles to empirically demonstrate knowledge creation vs. mere information transfer
	- ### Trust and Ethics in AI-KM
		- AlMuzaini et al. (2025) highlight this as core theme without resolution:
			- Who is responsible when AI-generated "knowledge" is wrong?
			- How do we maintain trust in knowledge bases augmented by AI?
			- What are the ethical implications of AI participating in organizational knowledge creation?
- ---
- ## 7. Future Research Directions
	- ### From Literature
		- **Integrated frameworks**: Combining AI capabilities with human judgment (AlMuzaini)
		- **Ethical guidelines**: Comprehensive frameworks for AI in KM (multiple sources)
		- **Sector-specific adaptation**: Moving beyond one-size-fits-all approaches (Tumwebaze, Wittenborg)
		- **SME-appropriate solutions**: Resource-efficient KM for smaller organizations (Hafeez)
		- **GenAI roadmaps**: Consolidated research agenda for GenAI–KM integration (Pimentel & Veliz)
	- ### Underexplored Areas
		- **Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)**: Tools like Obsidian, Roam, Logseq represent grassroots KM practice largely disconnected from academic KM literature
		- **Human-AI knowledge workflows**: How does KM theory apply when one "knowledge worker" is an AI agent?
		- **The internalization deficit**: If AI helps externalization but hurts internalization, what interventions restore balance?
		- **Knowledge loss in AI-mediated work**: Does AI assistance atrophy human knowledge capabilities over time?
- ---
- ## 8. Synthesis: What the Literature Reveals
	- ### Settled Questions
		- KM is valuable for organizational performance and innovation
		- Technology alone does not solve knowledge problems
		- Context matters — one framework does not fit all sectors/cultures
		- AI integration is happening and cannot be ignored
	- ### Unsettled Questions
		- Can AI truly participate in knowledge creation, or only information processing?
		- How do we measure knowledge (vs. information) empirically?
		- What is lost when tacit knowledge is externalized by/for AI?
		- Who bears responsibility for AI-generated "knowledge" errors?
	- ### The Emerging Paradigm
		- The literature points toward a **third generation of KM** characterized by:
			- Human-AI collaboration (not AI replacement of human knowledge work)
			- Recognition of AI's asymmetric capabilities (good at combination/externalization, poor at internalization)
			- Need for new frameworks that position AI as knowledge participant, not just tool
		- This third generation remains nascent — frameworks like HAC-SECI and GRAI are early attempts, not settled theory.

- # Implications for My Work
- ## Validation of Core Framework
	- The literature validates several elements of my [[Human-Agent Collaboration Framework]]:
	- **Human-AI collaboration over replacement**: AlMuzaini's first theme; HAC-SECI's dual-loop structure
	- **Externalization as critical bridge**: Empirical evidence (64% vs 15%) confirms AI accelerates externalization
	- **Internalization deficit**: The Heliyon finding (63.4% → 41.3%) supports why [[The human works through the agent's hands]] — AI can't replace the human's deep knowledge integration
- ## Extensions to Consider
	- **Trust and ethics**: My framework focuses on "embedded trust" vs "transferable trust" — literature suggests broader ethical dimensions worth integrating
	- **Sector-specific adaptation**: Current framework is generic; literature suggests value in domain-specific variants
	- **PKM connection**: The PKM tool ecosystem (Obsidian, Logseq) represents under-theorized space where my [[Manual context curation is the work]] thesis could contribute
- ## Research Gaps My Work Addresses
	- The literature calls for:
		- ✓ Frameworks for human-AI knowledge collaboration → [[Human-Agent Collaboration Framework]]
		- ✓ Understanding externalization in AI context → [[Knowledge Externalization as Agentic Interface]]
		- ✓ Practical implementation approaches → [[Manual context curation is the work]]
	- My work is positioned at the frontier the literature identifies — but largely outside the academic conversation. Opportunity: contribute to the "consolidated research agenda" Pimentel & Veliz call for.
