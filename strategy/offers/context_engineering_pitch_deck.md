# Pitch Deck: Context Engineering

## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Visual:** The "Context Stack" Hero Image (Glassmorphic layers glowing in deep space).
**Headline:** Context Engineering
**Sub-headline:** The Architecture of Intelligence.
**Footer:** A Future Skills Framework

---

## Slide 2: The New Reality
**Visual:** A split screen. Left side: A generic robot labeled "Commodity Model". Right side: A fortress labeled "Your Proprietary Context". The fortress is glowing; the robot is dull.
**Headline:** Models are Commodities. Context is the Moat.
**Body Copy:**
> "Same model. Different results."
In 2026, access to GPT-5 or Claude 4 is not an advantage—it's the baseline. The team that wins isn't the one with the best model. It's the one that can **externalize their knowledge** and feed it to agents in a structure they can understand.
**Key Insight:** "Context can't be downloaded. It has to be earned."

## Slide 3: The Problem
**Visual:** An illustration of "Context Rot". A long, messy scroll of chat history where the AI gets confused, forgets early instructions, and hallucintates. A "Memory Leaking" warning icon.
**Headline:** Why Your Agents Fail
**Body Copy:**
You treat AI as a chat partner, not a system component.
*   **Context Rot:** Important constraints are forgotten after 10 turns.
*   **Attention Dilution:** You overload the window with noise, drowning out the signal.
*   **Amnesia:** Every new session starts from zero. You are repeating yourself. Forever.
**Punchline:** This isn't a model limitation. It's an architecture failure.

## Slide 4: The Solution
**Visual:** A clean, schematic diagram. An "Architect" icon placing a structured block called `CLAUDE.md` into a slot, instantly stabilizing the agent.
**Headline:** Enter Context Engineering
**Body Copy:**
**Context Engineering** is the discipline of designing systems that provide language models with maximally useful information at minimal token cost.
It is **not** Prompt Engineering 2.0.
*   Prompt Engineering = What you say to the model.
*   Context Engineering = What the model knows, sees, and remembers.

## Slide 5: The Framework (The Context Stack)
**Visual:** The "Context Stack" Hero Image again, but labeled with the 4 Layers.
**Headline:** The Context Stack
**Body Copy:**
We don't just "chat." We build infrastructure across four layers:
1.  **Immediate (Level 0):** The visible prompt. Optimization for signal density.
2.  **Session (Level 1):** Managing the flow of a single task.
3.  **Project (Level 2):** Persistent memory (e.g., `CLAUDE.md`). The "Instruction Manual" for your project.
4.  **Reference (Level 3):** On-demand libraries. "Sacks of knowledge" loaded only when needed.

---

## Slide 6: The Curriculum
**Visual:** A "Skill Tree" progression map.
1.  **Level 0: Single Session Mastery** (Stop Hallucinating)
2.  **Level 1: Multi-Session Continuity** (The Checkpoint System)
3.  **Level 2: Persistent Memory** (Building `CLAUDE.md`)
4.  **Level 3: Organizational Moat** (Team-wide Context Systems)
**Headline:** From User to Architect
**Body Copy:**
A modular, 4-level certification program designed to take you from "talking to AI" to "deploying AI intelligence systems."
**Format:** 16-20h total. Modular workshops. Hands-on with Claude Code.

---

## Slide 7: The Outcome
**Visual:** A "Flywheel" diagram. "Good Context" -> "Better Outputs" -> "Learning Captured" -> "Improved Context Docs" -> Repeat.
**Headline:** Build a System That Learns
**Body Copy:**
Most teams lose their learnings when the chat window closes.
**Your Team:**
*   **Captures** insights into persistent context files.
*   **Automates** onboarding for new agents (and humans).
*   **Compounds** intelligence over time.
**Result:** An organizational asset that grows in value with every interaction.

## Slide 8: Final Call to Action
**Visual:** Minimalist typography on dark background. A cursor blinking after a command line prompt.
**Headline:** Stop Prompting. Start Architecting.
**Sub-headline:** Join the Context Engineering Skill Development Program.
