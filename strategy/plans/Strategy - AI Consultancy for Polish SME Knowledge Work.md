# AI Consultancy Strategy: Human-AI Collaboration for Polish SME Knowledge Work

---

## The Opportunity

### The market context

Polish SMEs are hearing the AI narrative: autonomous agents, automation, replacement of human work. Enterprise reports show 70%+ failure rates on agent deployments. ROI takes 2-4 years — five to ten times longer than expected. Companies that tried "autonomous" approaches are disappointed.

Meanwhile, practitioners who stay hands-on are getting extraordinary results. But this approach isn't being packaged and sold. The market is flooded with:
- Tool vendors selling subscriptions ("just use ChatGPT/Claude")
- Automation consultancies promising to remove humans from processes
- Technical integrators building custom AI systems

**What's missing**: guidance on *how to work with AI effectively* — not as automation, but as amplification.

### The target

**Polish SME knowledge work companies (10-200 employees)**:
- Law firms (small/medium practices)
- Consulting firms (strategy, management, HR)
- Financial advisory (accounting, tax, M&A advisory)
- Marketing agencies
- Research organizations
- Technical documentation / translation
- Architecture and design studios

**Why this segment**:
- Large enough to have workflow complexity worth optimizing
- Small enough that they can't afford failed AI experiments
- Knowledge work means high leverage for AI amplification
- Polish language adds friction to "just use the tools" — need localized guidance
- SME decision-making is faster than enterprise — shorter sales cycles

## The Positioning

### The core insight (our differentiation)

**"Human-AI collaboration, not automation."**

The dominant narrative: AI will automate your work. Remove humans from the loop. Build autonomous agents.

Our counter-narrative: The practitioners getting real results aren't maximizing autonomy. They're staying close to the work — curating context, reviewing intermediate outputs, directing the AI as a creative tool.

**The human isn't a bottleneck to remove. The human is the reason it works.**

### The framework we teach

1. **Context curation as the high-leverage skill** — what you put in front of the AI matters more than the AI itself
2. **The autonomy slider** — dial up or down based on task complexity, stakes, and how well-organized your knowledge is
3. **Intermediate artifacts** — don't go from raw inputs to final outputs; create checkpoints where humans review and steer
4. **Filesystem as collaboration space** — simple, transparent, inspectable organization beats elaborate AI memory systems
5. **Human as creative director** — you decide what to build, what matters, what's good; the AI provides leverage

### How we're different

| Typical AI Consultancy | Our Approach |
|------------------------|--------------|
| "Automate your workflows" | "Amplify your capabilities" |
| Build custom AI systems | Teach effective use of existing tools |
| Remove humans from processes | Keep humans in the creative seat |
| Promise autonomous agents | Deliver practical human-AI collaboration |
| High implementation cost, uncertain ROI | Lower cost, faster value capture |
| Technical integration focus | Workflow and skill development focus |

## Competitive Landscape (Poland)

### Direct competitors

**Large consultancies (Deloitte, McKinsey, Accenture)**
- Offer AI strategy but at enterprise scale/price
- Not focused on SME practical implementation
- *Our advantage*: Accessible, practical, SME-focused

**IT integrators / software houses**
- Focus on building custom solutions
- Technical implementation, not workflow/skill development
- *Our advantage*: Faster time to value, lower cost, no custom development needed

**Individual AI trainers / influencers**
- Offer generic "how to use ChatGPT" training
- Surface-level, not workflow-specific
- *Our advantage*: Deeper methodology, implementation support, industry-specific

### Indirect competitors

**DIY / self-learning**
- Companies trying to figure it out themselves
- *Our response*: We accelerate by 6-12 months, avoid common mistakes

**Tool vendors (OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft)**
- Increasingly offering guidance/training
- Generic, not localized, not implementation-focused
- *Our advantage*: Polish language, local market understanding, hands-on implementation

## Pricing Philosophy

**Value-based, not time-based**

- Anchor to business outcomes (hours saved, capacity gained, quality improved)
- Price at 10-20% of first-year value created
- Example: If workflow saves 10 hours/week for 3 people at 150 PLN/hour = 234,000 PLN/year value → price implementation at 25,000-45,000 PLN

**Land and expand**

- Entry point (audit) is low-risk, builds trust
- Implementation sprints are project-based, clear scope
- Advisory retainer creates ongoing relationship
- Each engagement should naturally lead to next

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| AI tools improve so fast our guidance becomes outdated | Framework is tool-agnostic; we teach principles, not button clicks |
| Large players enter SME market with scaled offerings | Our differentiation is hands-on, localized, relationship-based |
| Market wants "automation" not "collaboration" | Lead with results; let case studies show collaboration works better |
| Can't deliver consistent quality as we scale | Document methodology rigorously; hire for judgment, not just AI knowledge |
| Economic downturn reduces training/consulting budgets | Position as efficiency investment with clear ROI; offer smaller engagements |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Finalize the positioning essay** — "The Case for Manual Context Curation" in Polish
2. **Identify 3-5 founding clients** — from network, offer discounted audit + implementation
3. **Create basic sales materials** — one-pager, audit scope document, case study template
4. **Set up minimal infrastructure** — website, LinkedIn presence, scheduling
5. **Deliver first engagements** — learn, refine, document
6. **Build case studies** — quantified results, client testimonials

## The Deeper Vision

This consultancy is built on a genuine insight: the people getting extraordinary results from AI aren't trying to automate themselves out of the loop. They're becoming more ambitious, more creative, more capable — with AI as their tool.

The Polish SME knowledge work market is underserved by this perspective. Everyone's selling automation or tools. We're selling a different relationship with AI — one where human judgment, creativity, and direction remain central.

If we're right about this, we're not just building a consultancy. We're helping a generation of knowledge workers figure out how to thrive in an AI-augmented world — as creators, not supervisors.

That's the bet.
