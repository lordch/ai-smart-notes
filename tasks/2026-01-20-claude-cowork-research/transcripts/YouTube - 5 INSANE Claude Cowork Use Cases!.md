Five insane Claude co-workes. Claude just dropped something crazy. It's called Co-work and it's going to
change how you run your business. This thing automates tasks you spend hours on every single day. No coding needed. No
setup help. Just tell it what to do and it does it. I'm talking about organizing files, creating slides, posting videos,
tracking data, all the boring stuff that eats your time gone. And I'm going to show you five ways to use it right now
that will blow your mind. So what is co-work? It's a desktop tool from Anthropic. Think of it like having an
assistant who lives on your computer. You tell it what you want done. It does it simple as that. It can move files
around. It can open programs. It can fetch data from websites. It can create presentations. It can post content for
you. All the stuff that takes you forever handles it in seconds. [music] And the best part, you don't need to
know how to code. You just talk to it like a person. Say, "Hey, organize these files by date." Done. "Hey, create a
slide deck about my new service." Done. "Hey, post this video to my social accounts." Done. It's like magic, but
it's real. And it's available right now. I've been testing this thing for [music] the AI Profit Boardroom. And let me tell
you, the time savings are insane. Tasks that used to take my team an hour now take 2 minutes. Hey, if we haven't met
already, I'm the digital avatar of Julian Goldie, CEO of SEO agency Goldie Agency. Whilst he's helping clients get
more leads and customers, I'm here to help you get the latest AI updates. Julian Goldie reads every comment, so
make sure you comment below, and I'm going to walk you through exactly how to do this yourself. These aren't theory.
These are real use cases I'm using right now to scale faster and get more customers. Let's dive into use case
number one, desktop file organization. This one alone is worth the price of admission. How much time do you waste
looking for files? How many times have you downloaded something and it just sits in your downloads folder forever?
How many duplicate files do you have clogging up your system? Yeah, me too until now. With co-work, you can tell it
to organize your entire desktop or any folder on your computer. Just say, "Hey, take all the PDFs in my downloads folder
and move them to my documents folder sorted by date." Boom. done in seconds. Or say, "Hey, find all the images on my
desktop and put them in a folder called images organized by month." Done. But here's where it gets really powerful for
business. You can tell it to organize client files automatically. Let's say you run an agency like me. You've got
files all over the place. Client contracts, invoices, reports, project files, all mixed together. Total mess.
With Co-work, you just say, "Hey, create a folder for each client." And move all their files into the right folders based
on the file names. It scans everything, sorts everything, organizes everything. No manual work from you. I did this for
the AI profit boardroom. We had hundreds of files from members, questions they sent in, resources they shared, case
studies, all scattered. I told co-work to organize it all by topic and date. I created folders for SEO, for content
creation, for automation, for tools. Then it moved every file into the right place. Took about 3 minutes total. Would
have taken my team hours to do manually. You can also use this to clean up old files. Tell it, hey, find all files
older than 6 months that I haven't opened and move them to an archive folder. Or, hey, delete all duplicate
files. Or, hey, rename all these files to follow this naming convention. Whatever you need, it handles it. Now,
if you want to dive even deeper into AI automation, I've got something special for you. I run a community called the AI
Profit Boardroom. The best place to scale your business, get more customers, and save hundreds with AI automation.
Learn how to save time and automate your business with AI tools like Claude Co-work. The link is in the comments and
description. Use case number two, branded Google Slides creation. This one is a game changer for anyone who does
presentations, pitches, or client reports. Making slides takes forever. You've got to open Google Slides, create
a new deck, add your branding, add your logo, choose your colors, add your fonts, then actually add the content,
format everything, make it look good. Hours of work. co-work does all of this for you. You just tell it what you want.
It creates the whole thing, fully branded, ready to go. Let me give you a real example. Let's say I want to create
a pitch deck for the AI profit boardroom. I want to show people why they should join. I want to show them
the benefits, the community, the tools, the training, all of it. I just tell co-work, hey, create a Google Slides
presentation about the AI profit boardroom. include a title slide with our logo, a slide about what we do, a
slide about the benefits of AI automation for businesses, a slide about our community features, a slide about
how to join, use our brand colors which are blue and wire, make it look professional and clean, and it does it.
Opens Google Slides, creates a new presentation, adds all the slides I asked for, formats everything with the
right colors, adds text that makes sense, creates a layout that looks good all in a couple minutes. I just have to
review it and maybe tweak a few things, but the heavy lifting is done. You can use this for client proposals. Tell it,
hey, create a proposal deck for a new SEO client. Include slides about our services, our process, case studies,
pricing, and next steps. Use professional business colors. Done. You've got a proposal ready to send. You
can use this for training materials. If you're teaching your team something new, tell co-work to create a training deck.
Hey, make a presentation about how to use our new CRM system. Include slides on logging in, adding contacts, creating
deals, and running reports. Make it simple and easy to follow. Done. Training deck ready. You can use this
for webinars. Hey, create a slide deck for a webinar about AI automation for small businesses. Include an intro
slide, problem slides showing what takes too much time, solution slides showing how AI fixes it, example slides with
real use cases, and a call to action slide. Done. Webinar ready. Now, here's where things get even crazier. Use case
number three, video automation for social media. If you're trying to grow on social media, you know, you need to
post consistently. YouTube, Instagram, Tik Tok, LinkedIn, Facebook, all of them. But uploading videos to all these
platforms takes forever. You've got to log into each one, upload the video, add the title, add the description, add the
tags, add the thumbnail, schedule it, or post it, then do it again for the next platform. Co-work automates this entire
process. You can tell it to take a video file and post it to multiple platforms automatically. Let's say I just finished
recording a tutorial about using AI tools to get more customers. I've got the video file ready. Normally, I'd
spend 30 minutes uploading this everywhere. With co-work, I just say, "Hey, take this video file and post it
to YouTube with this title and this description, then post it to LinkedIn, then post it to Facebook, use the same
title and description for each." It does it, opens each platform, uploads the video, fills in all the info, posts it
or schedules it, all while I go do something else. This is massive for consistency. You can batch create
content and then have co-work distribute it everywhere. Record five videos on Monday. Tell co-work to post one per day
to all your platforms. Set it and forget it. For the AI profit boardroom, we create a ton of tutorial content. Every
time we find a new AI tool or automation that helps businesses scale, we make a video about it. Before Co-work, posting
these everywhere was a nightmare. Now, we just tell Coowork to handle it. We focus on making great content. Co-work
handles distribution. You can also use this for repurposing content. Let's say you made a long YouTube video. You want
to cut it into shorter clips for Instagram and Tik Tok. You can tell co-work, "Hey, take this video and
create three 30-second clips from the best parts. Then post those clips to Instagram reels and Tik Tok. Now you're
getting way more mileage out of one piece of content. Use case number four, recording and automating browser
workflows. This one is absolutely wild. co-work can watch what you do in your browser and then repeat it
automatically. Think about all the repetitive tasks you do online. Filling out forms, copying data from one site to
another, checking metrics, downloading reports, sending messages, all that stuff you do over and over. With
co-work, you do it once while it watches. Then it can do it automatically forever.
Let me explain. Let's say every Monday I need to check our website traffic in Google Analytics.
I log in, click to the right report, look at the numbers, write them down. Then I go to our email platform, check
how many new subscribers we got, write that down. Then I go to our payment processor, check our new member signups,
write that down. This takes like 20 minutes every week. With Co-work, I can record this workflow one time. I tell
it, hey, watch what I'm about to do and remember it. Then I do the whole process while it watches. I go to analytics. I
go to email. I go to payments. I grab all the numbers. Once I'm done, I tell Coowork, "Okay, now repeat this every
Monday morning and send me a summary of all the numbers. From now on, every Monday, Co-work does this automatically.
It goes to all the sites. It grabs the data. It compiles it. It sends it to me. I didn't have to code anything. I didn't
have to use Zapier. I didn't have to mess with APIs. I just showed it once and now it runs forever." Use case
number five, data fetching and metrics analysis. This is where co-work becomes a research assistant. You can tell it to
go find data online and analyze it for you. This is huge for making smart business decisions. Let's say I want to
understand what topics people in the AI automation space care about. Right now, I could spend hours researching forums,
social media, blogs, or I could tell co-work, hey, go research the top discussions happening in AI automation
communities right now. Find the most common questions people are asking. Summarize the trends and give me a list
of topics. Co goes out. It browses relevant sites. It reads discussions. It identifies patterns. It comes back with
a report. Now I know exactly what content to create for the AI profit boardroom. I know what our members need
help with. I know what topics will get the most engagement. All because co-work did the research. You can use this for
market research. Tell it, hey, find the top 10 competitors in the AI training space. Get their pricing, their main
features, and their target audience. Create a comparison table. Now you got competitive intelligence without hiring
an analyst. You can use this for content inspiration. Tell it, hey, find the top performing posts in business automation
groups from the last month. Summarize the main topics and engagement levels. Now you know what kind of content
resonates. You can use this for tracking your own performance. Tell it, hey, check our YouTube channel and get the
view count and engagement rate for our last 10 videos. Compare them and tell me which topics performed best. Now you
know what to make more of. You can use this for finding partnerships. Tell it, hey, find businesses that offer
complimentary services to what we do and will be good partners. Get their contact info. Now you've got a list of potential
collaborators without spending days searching. The beautiful thing about this use case is it turns co-work into
an intelligence gathering tool. Business is all about having good information. The better your data, the better your
decisions. Co-work gives you access to better data faster. And in competitive markets, speed matters. While your
competitors are still researching, you're already executing. For the AI profit boardroom, we use this
constantly. We track AI tool launches. We track what our members are struggling with. We
track industry trends. We track what content topics get traction.
All of this helps us stay ahead and deliver more value. And co-work makes it possible without needing a whole
research team. Now, let's talk about how to actually get started with co-work. First, you need access. It's a beta
product from Anthropic. You might need to join a wait list or check if it's available in your region. Once you've
got access, install it on your desktop. It works on Mac and Windows. The interface is simple. You basically chat
with it like you would with chat GPT or Claude, but instead of just answering questions, it can actually do things on
your computer. You tell it what you want. It asks for permission to access the apps and files it needs. You approve
it, then it goes to work. Now, if you want to dive even deeper into AI automation, I've got something special
for you. I run a community called the AI Profit Boardroom. The best place to scale your business, get more customers,
and save hundreds with AI automation. Learn how to save time and automate your business with AI tools like Claude
