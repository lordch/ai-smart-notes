Enthropic just dropped Claude Coowwork. And if you're anything like me, you're still trying to figure out what this
thing is actually powerful for. If you've been intimidated by Claude Code, thinking you need to be a coder to use
it, this changes everything. So, I brought on my friend Salmon, who is a Claude Code power user to break it all
down and show me the one skill building hack that turns Claude into a personal assistant that can do almost anything.
We're talking controlling your browser, connecting to your apps, building slide deck docs, etc. By the end of this
video, you'll know exactly how to start using Claude Co-work better than 99% of people who just opened it for the first
time. So, without further ado, let's jump right into this episode. All right, what is going on guys? Salman, I'm
stoked to have you on, man. You're a power user of Claude Code in my eyes. So, I'm excited to walk through what
Claude Co-work is and hopefully by the end of this video, my audience is going to be up to speed with how exactly they
could start using it if they're intimidated by using Claude Code. Right here, we have this Twitter post from
Enthropic. This is their release video of Claude Co-work which dropped yesterday and it's breaking the
internet. So, let's actually go ahead and talk about what Claude Co-work is. Compare it to Claude Code and begin
coming up with a couple of different use cases we could start using right now with it. So, Anthropic has been dropping
a lot of really cool stuff recently and it's kind of really getting confusing on when you should use which tool, right? I
actually like using this analogy to explain to people how you should look at these kind of releases. So, normally the
first thing you want to get started with if you're just starting out is Cloud Desktop. You can do this by just going
to cloud AI or anything and then you can just talk to it like chat GPT. And um I am a very big Pokemon fan. So, I use
this little Pokemon analogy to show you. And imagine this as the level of power user you are. All right. So claw desktop
is basically something that's self-contained. It is an AI chatbot. You can give it some powers here and there
with connectors, but normally people don't do that and it has limited context of what you're trying to do. What
happened recently is that Anthropic dropped this thing called Claude Co-work. And Claude Co-work essentially
has access to your files. It can control your browser with this really cool extension we'll show you later in the
video. And it can essentially be an agent for you and think of it like an extra pair of hands. But with that comes
a little bit more added complexity, but it's not that much. So if you just learn some little things, you should be able
to take advantage of it. And contrast that where you want to go superpower user mode, that's when someone uses
clawed code. And that's what I envision as Charizard per se where it can do multiple different things. It can be
running flying around forever autonomously for days and you know it just has a mind of its own. So that's
the difference. But I think for most professionals out there, Anthropic created this claude co-work so anyone
that isn't technical can just go to a very simple application where you just have a chat inbox and get all your work
done. That definitely clears up kind of what we would use this for because I guess for my audience like they probably
have heard of cloud code, have seen cloud code. Cloud code you're interacting in like a terminal or an IDE
where you're actually like coding. So if you're not a coder, sometimes that could be a bit intimidating. Instead, this is
almost just like using Claude as if you're using Claude on the web. If you're just on claude.ai and interacting
with it as if it's chatbt, but the interface looks a little bit different and just just not as complex as Cloud
Code. So, I'm excited to see kind of what the capabilities of it are, though, because you mentioned before we filmed
this that it's good, but it can't get you all the way there that Claude Code can, just like you said, this is more so
Charmeleon or however you say his name and not Charizard. >> Yeah.
>> Yeah. So, inherently how all these programs work is kind of different. And from that, I kind of just want to get
into how a person would actually use Cloud Co-work, right? And imagine this is you looking pretty good. And all you
need to do is just use this terminal that they have. And what Claude Co-work was really built for was to do kind of
like one-off tasks. So if I zoom out a little bit, you see you can spin off multiple instances of these clawed
co-workers, let's call them, which all do their independent task. They have their own context. They have their own
artifacts that they create. So for example, they'll create their own documents. They'll have their own
progress bars etc. So and their task is to get from point A to point B like hey you have all this inputs get me this
output that that's every task right and what is the differentiating factor between claude desktop and claude
co-work is this. So if I zoom out a little bit more I'm going to show you this. It's the fact that claude coowork
has access to all these little connectors of sorts and this thing called skills. All right. And to dive in
to what this kind of is is cloud desktop doesn't know what's in your files or it doesn't know what's in your Google Drive
or even what you're trying to do. It has no context. It's like, you know, there's a really smart guy who has no idea what
you're trying to do. Where >> That's a great point. Yeah. Yeah. Literally, it's like doesn't have hands
to go off and actually like do things, grab things, perform tasks for you. It's just like stuck inside of that little
like chat bubble kind of, right? >> Yeah. So it's like stuck inside of a chat bubble and it's kind of like
turnbased. You know how like actually maybe this is another Pokemon analogy where it's like you make a move and then
they make a move and it's like that. So that's stop. Claude co-work on the other hand. What that does is like you give it
a directive and then cloud co-work will spin up multiple instances which you won't see but it will essentially create
its own to-do list right and then it will spin up sub agents in the back which will action each of those to-do
lists using more capabilities like these connectors like for example it will go out grab some file it'll change your
Google Sheets maybe that's where some information is there's a lot of information stored in all different
places and let's say that thing you're um trying to do doesn't have an API. It just only can be done through your
browser. So, Claude Co-work actually has access to your browser as well through this little extension, which we'll get
into in a little bit. And another nice part about co-work is the fact that you can teach it skills. It's kind of like,
you know, when I said giving Claw Desktop hands, I mean it literally. You're giving it hands and you're
telling taking its hands and you're like, "Hey, this is how you do something. Remember this and the next
time I ask you to do that, go do that." So that's all fundamentally the difference between claude desktop and
claude co-work and when you should use each one. >> Okay. Yeah, that makes a ton of sense.
And for the skills, that's something where once they have this skill, you don't need to like go back and like
teach it how to do it or give it a specific prompt every single time. When you give it this task, it just knows,
okay, it's already explain, you know, Salmon's already broken down to me step by step how to perform this and it just
goes through that checklist. Right. >> Exactly. Yeah. So it it creates the checklist and even creates a
subchecklist. Like for example, maybe I'll show you in a little bit. We'll cover a case where essentially someone
would have to let's say you're given a task to make 10 different slides and there's a lot of substeps in between if
you think about it. You have to make the slide. You have to know what to write in the slide. You have to put a graphic in.
All those little things. M so those are done by different sub aents from the co-work that you actually don't see and
it's just happening in the background but claude coowork being its really cool agent itself is taking care of that.
>> Yeah that's crazy. Now that we have like a kind of understanding of how exactly clawed co-works, let's go ahead and
actually come up with a couple of use cases and show, okay, if you're a regular regular everyday person, what
could you start using this for right now? And we're going to give you some tangible use cases that you could either
go off and use. And Salman actually has a pretty cool example that he's going to show us now.
>> Yeah. Um, thanks Brock. So, I guess the first use case I'll show you, and this is really cool and one of my favorite
ones, is just using connectors to build slides, right? And I'll show you kind of like the end result right now just so
you have a quick little overview. And this is the stuff we can create with clot co-work right. And if I go to my
slide and you see for my company, it has all my assets like my logos. It creates these little emojis, all this stuff and
these little gifts. It finds it from my files, my asset folders, inserts them. And it also has context. You can build
all these random things that normally you would have to tell Claude on each step. All right. And to build this is
actually really simple. So step one, what you want to do is you want to go to zapier.commcp.
And what we're doing right here is just to refer back to my diagram. We are giving Claude coworker a skill or access
to do something. Okay? Like Google Slides. But the problem here is you'll see Claude actually does not have access
to um Google Slides. to get connectors right here. If you hit this plus and then hit connectors and then manage
connectors, you'll see there's a bunch of connectors, but it doesn't have access to Google slide, right? So, if
you actually want to give your cloud coworker superpowers to do things that it may not have the ability to do is you
go to Zapier, and then right here, you go to zapier.com/mcp. You hit new MCP server, you select a
client, and then see it literally has Claude for you. There's a lot of stuff, but you could just select Claude. It's
already being used MCP server. So, this is the one I've already built. And you can hit add tool and you can go to
slides and hit Google slides. And you see there's a lot of different things you can do. And all you do is you check
all of this stuff. You connect it. Boom. And it's that easy to just like connect Google slides giving your cloud code
access. And then you just connected like this. So you want to take your token. I don't want to show my token right now,
but let's claude. All you have to do is right here. You go here and then you go to Zapier in claude. Hit connect and you
paste your server URL here and hit continue. And then you just ask it to do stuff and it does it for you.
>> Yeah, that's crazy. And one thing to mention, so Zapier connects to, I believe, like 8,000 plus different
applications depending on what app you use. There's a good chance that Zapier probably connects with it and I think
across that has like 30 plus actions that it could perform. Yeah, exactly what Salman just circled there. So you
can just go find any of the apps you use, toggle that on, and now inside of Claude Co-work, it basically has the
ability to go off either pull information from there or to go and perform different actions. And of
course, depending on the app that you're using, the action might be a little bit different. But yeah, that's a that's a
sweet use case and kind of a little hack that people can start using when they're using Claude Co-work to kind of like I
don't know amplify the amount of things that it can go off and do cuz right now is it does seem a little bit limited if
you don't have MCP connectors set up. >> Yeah. So, uh, diving into that, this is actually really cool. So, now imagine
there isn't an MCP connector, right? What we can do is literally give Claude access to your browser with this
extension. So let's say I'll give you an example. Claude obviously doesn't want you to be controlling Gemini, right? And
let's say I want to use my Gemini to make a lot of slides because their Nano Banana Pro is incredible. So what I
could do, let's say someone tasks me that, hey, here are a million different prompts that I want you to use to
generate slides based off, right? I can just copy this. I can go to Gemini, right? And right here, rather than me
doing it, I can just paste this stuff here and I can be like, "Hey, create an image of each of these and do it."
Actually, no, let me show you this first. So, first I want to show you this. So, in the bottom right here, in
this little icon, you can teach Claude. So, you hit teach Claude, and I'm going to start recording. And right here,
let's say uh I have my >> It's literally watching what you're doing on your computer right now, and
it's going to emulate that. That's crazy. >> It's literally watching what I'm doing.
So, right now, let's say I'm going to go back to my mural board right here, and I'm going to grab this uh first prompt.
And then I go back here. Oh, that's the wrong one. Right here. And then I paste it. And then, do you see right here?
It's literally saying what's going on. And then I hit >> A jeez.
>> Yeah. So, it's literally recording what I'm doing. It's learning from my actions. Claude isn't stupid the next
times you ask it to do something. It just goes boom boom boom. It's much faster. So I always recommend if you
wanted to do something a lot, you teach it. Okay, cool. So now you just hit done. Now it has that skill. Okay, it's
recording the skill. It's generating the shortcut. How is it? Okay, that's really cool. Uh ask Gemini, right? And then
>> so you can name it whatever you want. Whenever you do forward slash or back, whatever that is. forward slash it. You
just tag it and then it just knows that specific skill will be then triggered to then go off and do it that way. Right.
>> Exactly. Yes. So you could just be like if you want to take it a step further, you see there's like a little schedule
button here. >> Mhm. >> And what you can do is let's say you
have to do this every day. You can schedule it for every day. >> Yeah. Jeez.
>> That's crazy, dude. It's crazy where we're going with this AI stuff. >> So now if I can just be like, "Hey, make
aski make pics of all these." It's going to go ahead and then hopefully like control my You see it's controlling my
computer when there's this like weird orange glow. It controls my computer and it's going to start doing these things
for me. So, it's like reviewing generated Jenga tower. You see how it's like taking a screenshot. It's scrolling
down, scrolling up, all this stuff. And for just times sake, I want to show you. I was just like playing around with it.
And here it just was just generating all these slides for me because I don't want to do this. I just gave it to Gemini and
I, you know, went to go grab a cup of coffee or water. >> That's crazy. And it's almost like uh it
has a specific style that it's sticking to. So, I'd assume you probably prompted it, I want it in a specific style. So,
it's always on brand with whatever slide or asset you're trying to create. That's just Dude, this is so crazy. Like, I
think us as people that are in the AI space, we literally research this stuff all day long and use it. For the people
that are getting into AI and have only heard of Chhatchevt or have used it a couple times, you see this and you're
like, are you this is insane. We could actually do this right now. It's just it blows my mind. This is so cool to watch.
>> Yeah. It's it's really when you're creative with this browser skill, the world's your oyster, right?
>> And the reason I'm harping on this um browser right here is because you can literally go to Claude. It knows the
skills you taught it, right? And because it knows all the skills you taught it, it can start doing it. Like you don't
have to go back to your browser anymore and then type it here. You can just type it here, spin up a new task, and it's
just going to go and get it done. >> Yeah, that's wild. >> And um I will say the last one, and I
I'll show this is like one thing that's huge. It's the fact that Claude Coworker is so good is because you can make it do
things that every other model can do. So, uh, if you guys have watched, uh, Avengers and you saw like Thanos with
the little Infinity Stones, you can think of Claude and equipping it with different Infinity Stones by using this
concept of skills. And for example, Google has the best image model, right? Claude literally cannot create images.
So, what we can do is we can give Claude a skill to create these images. Okay? And I'll show you how I did that. and
it's by this thing called skills. Uh hopefully you can see my screen, but right here you'll see if you go to right
here and in the settings, hit settings and then go to capabilities. If you scroll down, there is this thing called
skills and you can add any skill you want. You technically don't have to do this yourself because you could just be
like, "Hey Claude, learn this and then do it for me." Right? So, let's just to backtrack a tiny bit. If you explain
Claude to do something and it gets it done the way you want it to get done, can you just say, "Hey, I want you to
remember exactly how you did that and let's create a skill of that." >> Yeah, that that's literally what just
happened. >> Okay, got it. >> That is literally what just happened. We
just created a skill of it remembering how to do something. But now, this is taking it a step forward, right? It's
more so controlling it from one centralized location. So right now, for example, you can even like buy skills or
like find skills on the internet. So this is a random um repo I found on GitHub where it says awesome cloud
skills, right? And you can see you can like um do content research. So it's going to use perplexity enhance images.
Claude can't do this stuff, but you can feed it these skills. Like you can just be like, you go here, you go to Claude
desktop, and then you can just like go back to here, your claim, you can paste it here and be like, "Hey, download the
skill for XYZ, right?" And I'll do that. And just to show you, for example, Claude cannot literally cannot create
images. So what I did was I gave it the skill. I was like, "There's this thing called wave speed." Brock, do you know
about wave speed? >> Uh, yeah. I've heard of it. Yeah. >> Yeah. So wavepeed is this image
generation API, right? It can I can call Nano Banana Pro. I can make videos. I can make all this stuff with waves. And
I just inserted my waves API key in it. And I told Claude, hey, create a skill that whenever I need an image or a video
generated, you are going to call waves and do that. And then you see right here, it went ahead and then did it for
me. I don't want to show my API key, but it uses nano banana pro. And now I can just open my files and I can see Claude
generated these really cool images. >> Could you real quickly I want to see >> Yeah, that's crazy. Could you real
quickly show me like what Wavespeed looks like because I've I've played around with it a little bit, but I like
if I've never seen it before. I just want to know kind of exactly um what it would look like if we were to begin
using it. >> Yeah, so you go to wave speed.ai and I like wave speed because it's actually
really reasonable for uh their image and models. And I have some credits. I'm just logging in right now. And you see I
have a bunch of credits and I made some stuff but this is about it. So all I have to do is go to API keys, copied
this API key right here and I called it for agentic workflows. I copied that. I went back into cloud desktop. I pasted
that in and then I was like hey create this wave speed for me. And you can do this with any sorts of APIs or
connectors that you can think of. And then you see on the right hand side if Claude decides to use any cool tools
it'll literally tell you that hey I'm going to do search the web. I'm going to build this
>> markdown. I'm going to generate this image and it's literally just executing code. So it's generating images by
executing this Python file. But I don't need to know that. I just need to know that it generated my image.
>> Yeah, dude. That's so crazy. just by literally connecting it to one API and then it just has the ability to go off
and generate these images for us like you said because claude can't natively they don't have an image generation tool
just like chatbt does or um Gemini does obviously nano banana is great but like how do we even begin using that so you
found a workaround to generate the images with nano banana pro without you know integrating directly into Gemini I
guess so yeah that's wild >> exactly and this is why maybe I'll paste this in and this is how I think of plot
code right now If you see my screen, >> see, you can do so many things with so many tools. But
>> uh you'll see people on both spectrums are just going to be using cloud code because once you understand that it's so
extensible and you can do anything you want with it because it has access everywhere like an octopus, you get to
just use one tool and cancel out a million of your subscriptions, >> right? Yeah, that's that's crazy. I I
just love the fact that they released Claude Co-worker or I guess I keep calling it Claude Co-worker because it
feels like it is a co-orker, but Claude Co-work because before Claude Code just seemed overly technical, just was hard
to play around with in my opinion. I just hate staring at a terminal. It just makes me want to tear my eyes out. So
having an interface like this now, if you could go back to to the interface um inside of Claude Co-work, I'd love to
see just like Yeah, exactly. This is a super simple way to look at this. Um, and then we haven't even haven't really
touched on the artifacts as well, but like for example, if we're pulling data from files or something, if we have a
CSV file of something, we could then say, I want you to create a dashboard to visualize all of this information, for
example, and it could spin up in Vibe Code an actual user interface for you to begin playing around with. So it's kind
of claude co-work is combining claude claude code and like artifacts to be able to do all this inside of one
ecosystem now which is you know super simple to use. >> Yeah it's it's really cool. I feel like
like you can take claude coworker and code in to such high lengths if you just use it. That's why they literally just
like made three different tabs. Claude codework and then code. And it's ultimately the
same thing. It's just for again to refer back to this thing. It's for three different types of user. It's kind of
like um a gateway drug the cloud desktop into the cloud co-work now you're doing some really cool tasks and then you go
into cloud code and they all cost the same so it doesn't make a difference. >> Right. So if you're somebody that is
using cloud co-work now because the interface of it's just easier to use for nontechnical people. Do you like how far
does it get you? Is it is it still worth maybe learning how to use cloud code? I want to know what you think. Obviously,
this has only been out a day, so maybe you don't know the full limits that, you know, it has, but like from your first
impression of playing around with it cuz you've tested it quite a bit. What do you think? Like, is it still worth
learning Claude code? Is this just for a very specific type of person that doesn't want to have to touch a
terminal? What do you think? >> Um, I actually think it's dependent on your goals and what you do, right? So,
for example, if your job is to just let's say write copy, then just using cloud desktop is technically enough.
Whereas, let's say now you, you know, you go around some different tabs, you mess around with things, then you might
want to start using cloud co-work. But most people probably don't even need cloud code because most people are just
doing one-off tasks. I think you will naturally as you need it because all of them are in one package, just go up the
ladder. cloud code. What people are doing with this is actually just like mostly coding and that's why they it was
kind of like a marketing failure initially, but I understand the way they were going at it because it's kind of
like um you know how like Tesla made like their most expensive car first and then they made a little cheaper one like
the Model X and then they made like the Model 3. It's kind of like the same model Claude is following where they
threw everything at the wall with Claude code and then now making it easier and more accessible as we go.
>> Right. And correct me if I'm wrong, but Claude Code, people are using it for things that maybe Claude or Anthropic
didn't necessarily think they were going to use it for. And so now they're almost reverse engineering what are the users
of Claude Code using. How can we then make that more accessible to people that don't know how to code, for example? And
I feel like that is what Claude Co-work is. That's, you know, the Charmeleon right there. Like it's the perfect
middle grounds. Interesting to see how they've kind of reverse engineered what people are building with it, you know,
for people using cloud code but who aren't who aren't using it for coding, if that makes sense. So,
>> exactly. Yeah. One-off task and ch cloud code is like, you know, have agents, multiple agents and parallel instances
running in the background. Most people don't need that at all. >> Right.
>> So, I guess last question I have for cloud co-work is could we have multiple different tasks or agents running at one
time? >> Definitely. Yeah. Uh so that it's does that's the same thing as like how you
have multiple of these running. Um what you want to do is right here right here you see in cloud co-work you can just
open up they literally call it tasks. >> Yeah. >> So you have you make a task you make a
directive you hit go you make another task you make a directive you hit go and then you sit back and then you judge.
>> Yeah. So you're telling me you could click on one of those pre-loaded prompts. You could prep it for the day.
Go to the suggestions again. >> Uh the suggestions. Yeah. Exactly. You could click on prep for the day and then
go go to the top left again, create new task. While it's prepping for your day, it's also crunching data and it's also
creating a prototype. All that stuff. That's crazy that you could just have it go off do multiple different things for
you while like you said, you're grabbing your coffee or, you know, whatever you need to do.
>> Exactly. Yeah. Like for example, one of them is doing your meeting follow-up. Another one is like writing your
schedule. And because you can give it access the different cloud co-work instances, you can give it access to
different connectors. So it's a bit faster when it goes to do your work. >> Yeah. No, that makes sense. Uh I guess
maybe like one of my last questions here is a lot of my audience probably has used something like N to end. Do you
think this might replace the need for a lot of people to use Naden? Like I know you used to be a power user. Are you
still using it every single day or are you now transitioning more to learning the skill of using something like claude
code and co-work in your daily um workflows? >> So that's kind of like a double-edged
sword. I think most people will slowly start getting off NAND. But you see right here, if you go to connectors,
>> you could connect to N MCP. >> Yeah, Nad literally has an MCP. So, you can just go, you know, connect this and
then be like, "Hey, Claude, >> coworker, go build me this automation." And then it'll go do it.
>> Yeah. So, it depends on what you're trying to do and what your goals are. I personally have been moving my stuff a
bit away from naden and just like just been coding it myself, but I don't think everyone is knows how to code or even
needs to know how to code. So, it's like a different um type of scenario. >> Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. All
right, Salman, this has been awesome, man. I think we've definitely shown people the capabilities of Claude Code
and Claude Co-work. So, if people like what they've heard on this podcast and they want to connect with you or follow
you and learn more from you, where could they find you? >> Yeah, absolutely. So, I actually have a
YouTube channel of my own where I've been publishing a lot of Claude type content and even I started this
community that's um if you go to school.com/claude. I can't believe I got that but I started
a brand new on how to actually automate business processes with claude code or claude in general.
>> Awesome. So, is that free to join right now? >> Yeah, it's free to join right now. So go
ahead, ask me questions because right now it's just, you know, exploring how we can apply this technology to actually
supercharge our work. >> Mhm. 100%. And that's why I want to bring you on. So I'm glad we could do
it. >> Of course, Brock. Yeah. Happy to be here, man.
>> If you guys got some value, go follow Som and subscribe to my channel as well. Um, but with that being said, I
appreciate you guys hanging to the end and we'll see you in the next
