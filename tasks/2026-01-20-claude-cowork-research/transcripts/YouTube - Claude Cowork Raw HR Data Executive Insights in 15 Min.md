## Transcript

0:00 We need to talk. We need to talk about
0:02 Claude co-work. So last week I did an
0:07 article on fullstack hr and I also did a
0:09 podcast around claude code. And to put
0:13 it simply, Claude code is a tool which
0:16 makes you basically a programmer. One
0:18 can argue about that I know but still
0:21 it's insane. But the main obstacle for
0:23 many people is that in order to access
0:26 cloud code you have to use the terminal
0:28 or now you can also use the web
0:30 interface but mainly it's most powerful
0:32 when using the terminal. So the
0:35 interface itself becomes an obstacle but
0:38 I would argue that even if you're not a
0:40 programmer and I'm totally not a
0:41 programmer it's still worth the
0:43 investment or it was worth the
0:45 investment to make sure that you made
0:48 use of clawed code in the terminal. But
0:50 that was last week and this is this
0:52 week. And I have to state before I say
0:54 anything else that it's truly hard now
0:57 to not be hyperbolic about this, to not
0:59 overhype what's happening right now. But
1:02 it's also insanely exciting what's
1:04 happening right now. And it's hard to
1:06 contain the excitement right now. At
1:08 least for me, what I'm saying, it's hard
1:10 for me to be realistic about what's
1:13 possible and also what's actually going
1:15 on. So, as per always, I will just try
1:18 to do my best on not overselling it, but
1:21 also not underelling it and also to keep
1:23 you updated on what's happening in the
1:26 world of AI and how this will affect the
1:28 world of work. And I think we will I
1:31 will start by just showcasing what's
1:33 going on and showcase you Claude Co
1:36 because once again, it's live since last
1:39 night. Hence, we have the capability to
1:42 try it. And I've actually tried it quite
1:44 a lot myself. I stayed up a bit too late
1:47 last night just trying it and see what
1:50 it can do. And I think I found some
1:52 pretty good use cases. And I'm going to
1:54 start by showing you one of the most
1:56 solid use cases that I found so far. And
1:59 it's also a project that I started or
2:01 that I thought about starting in cloud
2:03 code. Hence, I thought it was
2:04 appropriate to instead of using cloud
2:06 code, I could just try a cloud co-work
2:08 to see the output from this as well. So,
2:11 this is claude co-work. And in order to
2:14 get here, you need to be on the max plan
2:17 of claude and that is at least 100 bucks
2:20 a month for utilizing this. And then you
2:23 also need to have a Mac. So, it's only
2:26 available on Mac as of now. And as you
2:29 can see, this is a research preview,
2:31 meaning once again that it's not done
2:33 yet. And Claude also states that you
2:35 should be cautious when using this as
2:37 well, because for example, there is the
2:39 risk of prompt injections. Meaning that
2:41 someone could basically infuse the
2:44 things you're downloading and the things
2:46 you're working on with bad intentions or
2:49 bad not bad code because it doesn't need
2:50 to be code, but just bad explanations
2:53 for Claude to utilize. So, you need to
2:55 be a bit meticulous on how you set your
2:57 approvals and whatnot. And one should
2:58 always be a bit cautious when using the
3:00 new tools. And I say that you should be
3:02 cautious, but I I'm not sure if I'm that
3:05 cautious myself. So, don't do as I do as
3:08 I say instead. But, as you can see, I've
3:10 tried some tasks here as well. I've
3:12 actually archived a couple of tasks as
3:13 well because it proved so useful last
3:16 night that I used it for real client
3:19 projects as well. And I yeah, I want to
3:21 be a bit cautious about that as well.
3:23 Down here you get examples of what cloud
3:25 corework can do. In my experience they
3:28 work really well. Uh I would also state
3:30 that what I found so far is that working
3:32 with connectors for example then
3:34 integrating your Gmail, integrating
3:37 other connectors that you might have. I
3:39 have my to-do list for example connected
3:40 into cloud. That doesn't work as well
3:43 yet. I hope it will in the future. It
3:45 works from time to time but I found it
3:48 to be a bit wonky when trying to utilize
3:50 the connectors. But right now, what I
3:52 found it to be working in the most
3:54 proficient way is basically to think
3:56 about the things you can do on your
3:58 computer and it's really excelling at
4:00 more or less everything that I've thrown
4:01 at it so far. What we're going to throw
4:03 at it as of now is to analyze a big
4:06 chunk of people analytics data. So I
4:09 have a folder here. It's dummy data that
4:11 I've I've created once again for another
4:12 project that I was about to spin up. And
4:15 we're going to see now what Claude Co
4:17 can do with this data. and it's totally
4:19 unstructured and it's totally undefined.
4:21 It's just a folder with a lot of data.
4:23 And let's see what what Claude makes out
4:26 of it as well. I'm going to start here
4:28 by talking to the model. And I really
4:29 talking to my models because I think
4:31 that's a proficient way of describing
4:33 what you want. And yeah, let's see what
4:35 Claude cowwork will spin up here. In
4:38 this folder, I have unstructured people
4:40 analytics data. I want you to analyze
4:42 that and give me the executive summary
4:44 of what's happening in this data. Show
4:47 me patterns, show me things to focus on
4:50 and also propose uh where I need to pay
4:54 extra attention and where we have risks
4:56 and where we also have things that are
4:58 working really well for us as well. Uh I
5:01 want you to present that uh all of this
5:03 in a PowerPoint and present it in an in
5:07 a fashion that makes it exclusive and
5:09 nicely designed. You don't need to use
5:11 my PowerPoint skill that I've uploaded.
5:12 You can use whatever you deem suitable,
5:15 but make it nice looking. And I want the
5:17 full analyst. I want the full analyze of
5:21 all the data and yeah, propose if I need
5:23 to do anything else. Basically, anything
5:25 that I'm missing or biases or blind spot
5:27 that I might have in regards to this
5:29 data. Uh, so there we have it. You can
5:31 choose different models here. I'm
5:32 usually using Sonet 4.5, but for this
5:34 I'm going to use Opus 4.5 because that's
5:36 the latest and greatest model. I find
5:39 that to be very slow sometimes right
5:41 now. I don't know if it's a lot of
5:42 people using it or if it's just the way
5:45 cloud cloud co-work is set up, but for
5:47 this task, I'm definitely going to use
5:48 Opus 4.5 to see okay, how will they do
5:52 with all of this? I'm going to start
5:54 this now and oh, most likely the part
5:57 you will see now will be sped up because
5:59 I think this will take quite a while.
6:01 So, I'm going to just let Claude do its
6:05 work here as well. I think it will start
6:07 by just reading it and then just see if
6:10 there's anything else that it needs from
6:12 me or if usually it asks a couple of
6:15 questions back to me as well and you can
6:17 see what it's doing as well. It if you
6:20 run into errors it's totally fine
6:22 because it will sort those errors itself
6:24 running command but it what it doing now
6:27 and I've read this at Simon Wilson's
6:29 Substack which I will link below. It's
6:31 running basically called code code in
6:33 the background to some extent but it's
6:34 also more advanced and complex than that
6:36 according to Simon at least. Uh but
6:39 basically what we have here is an
6:40 interface towards cloud code but with
6:42 extra specialties and all of that. So
6:46 now it's going to do a comprehensive
6:47 view of all the data and I'm just going
6:50 to let it do that and I'll get back as
6:52 soon as that the full data is done
6:54 basically.
6:57 And here we have it. Here's the final
7:01 result from Claude Co. And I would say
7:04 it took roughly 15 minutes to get this
7:07 all over with. But it was it is it's a
7:11 lot of it's a lot of data. So it's 1 2 3
7:13 4 5 6 7 8 nine data points which it's
7:17 now compiling somehow. And let's see how
7:20 it did. So we allow this to be open in
7:23 PowerPoint. I will drag in that so you
7:26 can actually see this.
7:28 This is the people analytics executive
7:30 insights. I have no clue if this is good
7:33 or bad.
7:35 Oh, I see it's a bit wonky here. It's
7:37 not fantastic, but that's just a
7:39 formatting issue.
7:42 Strengths and critical risks as per
7:44 requested workforce overview. Critical
7:47 concerns.
7:49 Okay, this is not good. They need to
7:51 work on the EMPS turnover analysis.
7:54 Uh this is also not perfect of course
7:58 and yeah as we can see here as well pay
8:01 equity risks interesting it's doing that
8:04 as well training and development okay
8:06 financial overview
8:09 manager effectiveness
8:12 data blind spot interesting
8:15 recommendations strategic
8:16 recommendations
8:19 great
8:22 but not great that we have all of these
8:24 issues But as you can see this is what
8:26 it did. That's the whole thing here as
8:28 letter here as well. And I know since I
8:31 created that data in order to validate
8:33 the data I know that at least the MPS
8:36 and also the number of employees and
8:38 also turnover analysis everything there
8:41 as I can see now just by checking the
8:43 data is correct. Once again I have
8:45 created it. So I have confidence in that
8:47 the data is correct. But you can have
8:49 confidence in data as well that you
8:51 upload if as long as you upload the data
8:53 the right data. I think it's doing the
8:54 right conclusions. You need to spot
8:56 check this or maybe even for the first
8:58 time check it all. But that's as per
9:00 usual. I think it saves time still. We
9:03 can also do this. Talk to it again.
9:06 Can you create an artifact visual
9:08 dashboard that I can have as well? Just
9:11 create that
9:15 because now we did a PowerPoint. I could
9:17 also potentially I believe at least
9:18 we'll see if this works or not. I could
9:20 potentially do this as an a web page as
9:23 well and I let's see if we can do it. I
9:26 think we could even include maybe some
9:29 kind of chat function into the
9:31 dashboard, but I'm not sure about that.
9:33 So, let's start with doing the proper
9:35 dashboard at first or the a proper
9:37 dashboard on on the web. Here we have a
9:39 dashboard and I can now hopefully at
9:42 least open this in comment,
9:48 not comment. Yeah. And where here we
9:50 have a
9:54 dashboard of this as well.
9:56 Let's see. Now this is the extra sparkle
9:99 on the top. But can we see if we can add
10:01 some kind of model so I can actually
10:04 talk to my data in the interactive
10:05 dashboard as well. And let's see. Can
10:08 you add so I can chat with my data in
10:10 the artifact as well. So could you add a
10:12 chat window which draws from the data or
10:16 the insights from the data that I've
10:17 uploaded? Could you create that
10:19 functionality within the artifact the
10:21 dashboard that is as well? I'm not sure
10:22 if this is possible. We'll see. I said,
10:25 but given that it has claw code
10:27 capabilities
10:29 might be possible. Let's see. It's it
10:33 says that it can do it, but let's see if
10:35 it's can do it or not. I'm not sure if
10:39 it's if it's possible, but who knows?
10:43 I've been surprised before by this
10:46 marvelous tool called Claude. So, we'll
10:50 see. And now, here we go. Let's see if
10:53 we have this. Once again, this is a long
10:56 shot. I have no clue if this working or
10:58 not, but if it's working, you'll soon
11:01 hear me scream.
11:03 Okay, that looks very much the same. But
11:05 we have a chat function here as well.
11:08 Hello, I'm your people analytics
11:10 assistant. Okay, give me the top three
11:12 risks.
11:18 Ah, it's insane.
11:21 It's insane.
11:23 Tell me about the best managers.
11:28 I have no clue if that's worked. Okay.
11:30 Yeah. Okay.
11:33 Uh,
11:38 okay.
11:40 I obviously haven't verified this, but
11:42 okay.
11:45 Consider pairing lowcoring managers with
11:47 high performers.
11:50 Okay,
11:52 it worked. Let's just say that once
11:55 again. It's hard not to see how this
11:57 will impact the future of work going
12:00 forward. We're moving rapidly to a place
12:03 where we can just ask questions, where
12:05 we can pose questions, and but once
12:07 we've done that, we get something out of
12:09 it as well. Is it 100% correct? Is it
12:12 100% foolproof? Is it perfect right now?
12:15 No, it's not. Is humans 100% correct all
12:17 the time? No, we're not. Uh, is it good
12:19 enough for now? It's absolutely good
12:21 enough for now. Is this a space you need
12:23 to be watching if you're in HR? If
12:25 you're a leader, 100%. I have to state
12:29 this very firmly and very clearly. You
12:31 need to pay attention to this space now.
12:34 You need to understand the impact what
12:36 this will mean for your organization and
12:38 you need to understand that now. Uh
12:40 because those who figure this out the
12:43 fastest, they will be more ahead than
12:46 others as well. And we need to stop
12:48 thinking that this is something that
12:49 will happen in the future, the future is
12:50 already here. We need to adapt. We need
12:52 to adjust. We need to act accordingly as
12:54 well. The example I gave now, of course,
12:57 it's one of many examples and I don't
12:59 know how long this would have taken a
13:01 quite skilled people analytics person to
13:03 pull together. I'm not sure, but it's
13:06 certainly longer than 15 minutes that I
13:08 can guarantee at least. And once again,
13:10 if you can do this on a scale, on a
13:12 larger basis, if you can find other use
13:14 cases within your organization, then
13:16 obviously you will be further ahead than
13:18 other organizations. It's that simple.
13:21 and change my mind if you think I'm
13:23 wrong and then argue with me back
13:24 because we need to argue. We need to go
13:26 back and forth around this topic right
13:28 now because this is changing the way we
13:32 work. It's ignorant to not pay attention
13:34 to this era. It's ignorant to not try
13:37 these tools. And yes, it's a hundred
13:39 bucks a month, but in the larger scheme
13:42 of things, a 100 bucks is nothing. And
13:45 what's your excuse to not be playing
13:48 around with this? It needs to be a good
13:50 one. It needs to be a valid one because
13:52 we can't ignore this. It's happening
13:54 now. We're seeing the new world of work
13:58 shapen before us and and we need to get
14:01 on this. We need to try it and we need
14:04 to understand it and we need to help
14:06 people adopt accordingly and we need to
14:09 steer organizations intentionally. Will
14:12 this just happen or will it be intention
14:14 driven? We need to think about this. So
14:16 I urge you once again, try it and if you
14:18 need help, reach out. There's plenty of
14:21 us doing this on a regular basis,
14:23 helping organization. Reach out to any
14:26 one of us. If you don't, if you feel
14:27 uncomfortable doing it by yourself, it's
14:29 totally fine. You don't need to reach
14:31 out to me. You can reach out to anyone
14:32 as long as you do it. But we need to
14:34 start thinking, pondering, and we need
14:36 to stop thinking, but we need to stop
14:38 the whole discussion about oh, will this
14:40 change or what we will do stuff,
14:41 explore, try, test. That's what we need
14:44 to do. And we need to talk about it as
14:45 well. So, I hope we'll continue that
14:47 conversation as well and I'll do my best
14:49 to nudge that conversation and keep the
14:51 conversation going forward. That's it
14:53 for today. I have no clue how long this
14:55 video will be.
