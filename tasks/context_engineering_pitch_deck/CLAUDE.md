# CLAUDE.md - Context Engineering Pitch Deck Task

## Goal
Create a high-fidelity pitch deck for the "Context Engineering" course.

## Artifacts in this folder
- `deck.html`: A self-contained HTML presentation (using reveal.js via CDN or simple CSS) for the pitch.
- `assets/*.png`: Generated image assets for slides.
- `context_engineering_pitch_deck.md`: The content source (already exists in strategy/offers/, but we reference it here).

## Style Guide
- **Visuals:** Dark Glassmorphism, Deep Space Blue background, Neon Cyan (#00F5FF) and Emerald Pulse (#50FFAB) accents.
- **Tone:** Professional, Visionary, Technical but Accessible.
- **Key Metaphors:** The "Context Stack", The "Moat", The "Architect".

## Workflow
1.  Generate images for key slides (Robot vs Fortress, Context Rot, Stack Diagram, etc).
2.  Build `deck.html` embedding the markdown content and images.
3.  Ensure the deck is viewable in a browser.
