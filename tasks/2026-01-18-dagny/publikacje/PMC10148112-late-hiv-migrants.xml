In 2019, 44% of those newly diagnosed with HIV were migrants, from sub-Saharan Africa (18%), Latin America/Caribbean (9%), Central/Eastern Europe (8%), and Western Europe (3%) (ECDC, 2020a).</p><p id="para0011">Over half (53%) of women with HIV are diagnosed late in Europe (CD4 &lt; 350 cells/ml or AIDS-defining illness). Late presentation is more common among migrant women, especially those from sub-Saharan Africa (57%), and South/Southeast Asia (54%) <xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Nevertheless, evidence suggests that migrants face barriers to accessing prevention and testing services, and that they are not routinely prioritised in national guidance and recommendations.</p><p id="para0012">The ECDC states that action to remove those barriers faced by undocumented migrants it is a priority (ECDC, 2020a). Emerging evidence indicates that a significant proportion of migrants, even those originating from HIV-endemic areas, acquire HIV after arrival in the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA), suggesting the need for targeted HIV prevention and testing programs on and beyond arrival, including regular HIV testing <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p id="para0013">More accessible testing and combined prevention/care services are needed for the diverse group of migrants at risk of, or living with, HIV <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Identifying and removing structural barriers, such as limited eligibility for healthcare due to uncertain residency status, and facilitating a non-discriminatory healthcare environment can increase the effectiveness of these interventions <xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Unlike with other key populations (men who have sex with men (MSM) and people who inject drugs (PWID)), there is no clear guidance on the key components of prevention that should be available for migrants, or specifically for migrant women, although community-based testing is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) 2021 progress report <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> outlines HIV testing recommendations as reported within country-specific guidelines. The progress report states that 90% of the countries that have published national HIV testing guidance have included content specific to the needs of key populations. While PWID and sex worker populations were included in 82% and 74% of guidance documents, respectively, the lowest rates were among migrants and transgender people, with particularly low rates in Eastern Europe. Similarly, among those countries with published recommendations on frequency of testing for key populations, migrants and transgender people were the least likely population groups to be mentioned.</p><p id="para0014">Migrant women have an increased risk of HIV acquisition.

A study from the UK found that existing screening models were not perceived as widely accessible to the new migrant community <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.

In the same study, migrant women were mostly diagnosed in a hospital setting (40.1%), followed by a general practitioner (GP) setting (17.5%), and a sexual health or HIV testing clinic (12.5%); 14.7% of diagnoses among migrant women were made in &#8216;other&#8217; settings <xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.

Access to primary care among migrant women ranged from 96.8% in northern Europe to 56.4% in southern Europe <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, only 14.2% had been offered an HIV test by their GP, to which 13.3% agreed.

This suggests a need to explore windows of optimal opportunity for HIV testing alongside routine arrival and antenatal screening options. This was also shown in a recent study by Borchmann et&#160;al.

Some studies provided evidence indicating the need for HIV testing facilitators, but this was not always documented explicitly in relation to migrant women. The heterogeneity of the data made it challenging to recommend definitive actions for addressing structural, social, and individual barriers to HIV testing among this population.</p><p id="para0056">Limitations of our review methodology may have led to a failure to obtain more relevant information. No papers were retrieved that exclusively discussed reasons for late HIV diagnosis or facilitators of HIV testing among migrant women. Few papers were retrieved based on data from Central and Eastern Europe, where especially non-EU countries have significantly different structures, economic characteristics, rules, and regulations. Moreover, the barriers to HIV testing in those countries and for migrants of different origins (including those not only from African or Latin American countries, but also from the Middle East, with completely different cultural and social characteristics) may be significantly different from those in the EU/EEA or Western European countries. Thus, the results of this study may not be generalized for all of Europe. It is noteworthy that our review did not include data concerning populations affected by the current migration from Eastern European war zones. It is also possible that publication bias and imprecision within the review affected the outcomes reported.</p></sec><sec id="sec0014"><title>Suggestions for further research</title><p id="para0057">High rates of late HIV diagnosis and, among cases, poor reported experiences with HIV care systems and physicians, highlight migrant women as being a key population in need of better access to HIV testing, treatment, and care.

Migrant women are a key population for HIV acquisition. However, few data have been reported over the past decade, specifically relating to the barriers and facilitators of HIV testing among this group in Europe. Further research to review factors that delay or facilitate HIV diagnosis among these populations is needed.</p><p id="para0070">Many studies have reported on individual behavioural choices that have led to delayed HIV testing. This model places the emphasis on the individual's responsibility for their own health rather than examining the sociocultural and structural factors impacting migrant health-seeking and community experiences, and subsequent outcomes related to late HIV diagnosis. Our review included studies reporting on the structural barriers presented by national healthcare policies and migrant population access to care being as significant as barriers to HIV testing and care. Therefore, interventions that address structural barriers, and support early and frequent HIV testing, may be more effective.</p><p id="para0071">This review has highlighted the distinct lack of available data on a susceptible, diverse, and growing population in Europe. Focused interventions and extended research are needed to address the inequalities in healthcare experienced by migrant women. The removal of barriers to accessing HIV testing, minimizing individual and social stigma, and a focus on early testing and diagnosis are urgently needed. This will require support from non-governmental organisations and immigration authorities, in addition to ongoing education and upskilling of healthcare workers who provide care for socially marginalised groups, including migrant women. Changes to wider health policies and practice are likely to influence structural barriers to HIV testing &#8212; for example, rights to healthcare for documented versus undocumented migrants <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Importantly, taking an inclusive approach to research and service design and development may ensure that the experiences, perceptions, and needs of migrant women are embedded from the outset.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Competing interests</title><p id="para0072">MD, DK, and PL declare no competing interests.
