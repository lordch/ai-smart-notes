# Future Skills in the AI Era

**As AI takes over execution, the valuable human skills shift upward: from doing the work to shaping the tools, directing the process, judging the outputs, and deciding what's worth building. These skills can be learned and taught.**

---

## The Shift

### Old model: Human as Executor
- Value = ability to produce outputs
- Skills = domain expertise + execution capability
- Bottleneck = time and capacity

### New model: Human as Shaper/Director
- Value = ability to shape what AI produces
- Skills = context curation, specification, judgment, vision
- Bottleneck = clarity of intent, quality of direction

From the discourse on AI and work:
> "A shift is already underway toward humans shaping tools, environments, and opportunities in fundamentally new ways."

The programmer → product manager shift is one instance of a broader pattern: roles move "up the stack" from execution to direction.

## The Five Layers of Future Skills

### Layer 1: Shaping (Kształtowanie)

*Building the environment and infrastructure for AI collaboration*

| Skill | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Context Curation** | Deciding what AI sees | Organizing knowledge base, selecting files for context |
| **Environment Design** | Building collaboration space | Folder structure, AGENTS.md, workflow design |
| **Tool Configuration** | Adapting tools to your needs | Custom instructions, slash commands, skills |
| **Opportunity Recognition** | Seeing where AI provides leverage | "This task can be delegated / This requires human judgment" |

**Key insight**: The filesystem as "ba" — the shared space where knowledge creation happens. See [[The Filesystem as Agentic Ba]].

**Connection to framework**: This is [[Manual context curation is the work]] — the high-leverage activity that shapes everything downstream.

---

### Layer 2: Directing (Kierowanie)

*Guiding AI through tasks and iterations*

| Skill | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Specification** | Articulating requirements precisely | Writing specs, defining "done", stating constraints |
| **Decomposition** | Breaking problems into AI-sized chunks | "First research, then plan, then execute" |
| **Iteration Steering** | Guiding the feedback cycle | "Not like that, change X, keep Y" |
| **Autonomy Calibration** | Deciding how much to delegate | [[The Autonomy Slider]] — dial up or down based on task |

**Key insight**: Specification is not input to a translator. It's a shared artifact of understanding — evidence that human and agent reached agreement.

**Connection to framework**: This is [[Supervision is context curation, not action approval]] — the human shapes inputs, not just approves outputs.

---

### Layer 3: Judging (Ocenianie)

*Evaluating AI outputs and making selections*

| Skill | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Quality Assessment** | Evaluating if output is good | "This is on-brand / off-brand", "This meets the bar" |
| **Verification** | Checking correctness | Fact-checking, code review, logic validation |
| **Selection** | Choosing among options | "Of these 5 variants, this one because..." |
| **Taste/Judgment** | Subjective value assessment | "This is interesting / banal", "This resonates / falls flat" |

**Key insight**: As generation becomes cheap, judgment becomes expensive. The human bottleneck shifts from production to evaluation.

**Connection to framework**: [[Middle artifacts as collaboration checkpoints]] — human review at intermediate steps catches errors before they compound.

---

### Layer 4: Creating (Tworzenie)

*Deciding what to build and what matters*

| Skill | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Vision Setting** | Deciding WHAT to build | "I want to create X, not Y" |
| **Problem Finding** | Identifying problems worth solving | "The real problem isn't A, it's B" |
| **Meaning Making** | Interpreting, giving sense | "This data means that...", "The insight here is..." |
| **Novel Combination** | Combining things in new ways | Vibe-coding: "What if we built an app that..." |

**Key insight**: AI extends what's possible to create. With capable tools, you think bigger. You attempt things you wouldn't have attempted. The constraint shifts from capability to imagination.

**Connection to framework**: [[The human works through the agent's hands]] — the human decides what to build, the agent provides leverage.

---

### Layer 5: Connecting (Łączenie)

*The irreducibly human skills*

| Skill | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Stakeholder Understanding** | Understanding people and needs | "What the client really wants is..." |
| **Trust Building** | Building relationships and reputation | Track record, reliability, personal connection |
| **Context Translation** | Translating between worlds | "For technical team this means X, for business Y" |
| **Accountability** | Taking responsibility | "I own this outcome" |

**Key insight**: These skills are about human-to-human connection. AI can assist but not replace them. They become MORE valuable as execution becomes commoditized.

---

## The Execution → Direction Shift by Role

| Role | Old focus (Execution) | New focus (Direction) |
|------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Programmer** | Writing code | Specifying requirements, reviewing AI code, system design |
| **Analyst** | Running analyses | Framing questions, validating results, interpreting meaning |
| **Marketer** | Creating content | Defining brand voice, curating context, selecting variants |
| **Lawyer** | Researching cases | Directing research, applying judgment, client counsel |
| **Consultant** | Producing deliverables | Problem diagnosis, synthesis, client relationship |

The pattern: **domain expertise remains essential, but its application shifts from doing to directing**.

---

## What This Means for Learning & Development

### Old L&D focus:
- Domain knowledge (what to know)
- Technical skills (how to execute)
- Tools training (which buttons to click)

### New L&D focus:
- **Shaping skills**: Context curation, environment design
- **Directing skills**: Specification, decomposition, iteration
- **Judging skills**: Quality assessment, verification, taste
- **Creating skills**: Vision, problem finding, novel combination
- **Connecting skills**: Stakeholder understanding, trust, accountability

### Teachable vs. Developed

| Layer | Teachability | How to develop |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| **Shaping** | High — concrete techniques | Workshops, practice with tools |
| **Directing** | High — frameworks and patterns | Exercises, real projects |
| **Judging** | Medium — criteria can be taught, taste develops | Exposure, feedback, calibration |
| **Creating** | Low-medium — can enable, hard to teach directly | Environment that encourages experimentation |
| **Connecting** | Low — interpersonal, experiential | Experience, mentorship, relationships |

**Implication**: Shaping and Directing skills are highly teachable — this is where training has most leverage.

---

## Connection to Context Engineering

[[Context Engineering]] is a *subset* of Future Skills — specifically within Layer 1 (Shaping) and Layer 2 (Directing).

| Context Engineering covers | Future Skills layer |
|---------------------------|---------------------|
| Context Curation | Shaping |
| Environment Design | Shaping |
| Tool Configuration | Shaping |
| Specification | Directing |
| Decomposition | Directing |
| Autonomy Calibration | Directing |

**Context Engineering is the teachable core** — the concrete skills that enable the rest.

But the full picture includes Judging (quality, taste), Creating (vision, problem finding), and Connecting (human relationships).

## Two Framings for Different Audiences

### For practitioners (individual contributors):
> "These are the skills that make you effective with AI. You can learn them. Start with Context Engineering (Shaping + Directing), develop Judging through practice, bring your own vision (Creating), maintain your human connections (Connecting)."

### For leaders (L&D, HR, executives):
> "As AI handles execution, your people need different skills. Not 'how to use ChatGPT' but how to shape, direct, judge, create, and connect. Here's a framework for thinking about capability development in the AI era."

## Relation to "Amplification vs Automation"

From [[Blog - The Case for Manual Context Curation v3]]:

**Vision A: Automation** — AI does the work, humans supervise
- Skills needed: monitoring, approval, error-catching
- Human role: diminishing

**Vision B: Amplification** — AI extends human capability
- Skills needed: shaping, directing, judging, creating, connecting
- Human role: elevated

**This framework assumes Vision B.** If you believe in amplification, these are the skills that matter.

---

## The Bet

> "The people getting most value from AI agents aren't excited about having their work done for them. They're excited about what they can create."

The future skills aren't about surviving AI replacement. They're about **thriving in a world where you can build things that were previously impossible**.

The constraint isn't capability anymore. It's imagination.

---

## Open Questions

1. **How do these skills interact with domain expertise?** — Is domain knowledge still necessary, or can generalists with good AI skills outperform specialists?

2. **Which skills are most scarce?** — Where's the bottleneck in organizations trying to adopt AI?

3. **How fast can these be developed?** — What's the realistic timeline for upskilling a workforce?

4. **Does this vary by industry?** — Are some sectors more amenable to this shift than others?
