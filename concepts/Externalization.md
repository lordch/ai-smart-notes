# Externalization: The critical bridge in organizational knowledge creation

**Externalization—the conversion of tacit knowledge into explicit concepts—is the "quintessential knowledge-creation process"** according to Nonaka and Takeuchi's foundational SECI model. It transforms personal, context-specific insights into shareable organizational assets through metaphors, analogies, dialogue, and collective reflection. Yet this transformation is inherently difficult: deeply embodied and emotional knowledge resists articulation, and any conversion process inevitably loses some fidelity. Recent research (2024-2025) has extended externalization concepts to AI systems, with frameworks like HAC-SECI and GRAI positioning generative AI as active participants in knowledge creation—though these applications reveal that AI excels at externalization's early phases but struggles with the deeper internalization that completes the knowledge spiral.
- ## Theoretical foundations trace from Polanyi to organizational practice
  
  The SECI model (Socialization, Externalization, Combination, Internalization) emerged from Ikujiro Nonaka's 1994 paper "A Dynamic Theory of Organizational Knowledge Creation" in *Organization Science* and was fully elaborated in Nonaka and Takeuchi's 1995 book *The Knowledge-Creating Company*. They defined externalization as **"the process of articulating tacit knowledge into explicit concepts"** where knowledge becomes "crystallized, thus allowing it to be shared by others, and it becomes the basis of new knowledge."
  
  Nonaka drew heavily on philosopher Michael Polanyi's concept of tacit knowledge from *The Tacit Dimension* (1966), encapsulated in the famous formulation: **"We can know more than we can tell."** Polanyi described tacit knowing as a process based on "indwelling"—incorporating something into one's physical-mental self. His from-to structure explains how we attend FROM tacit knowledge TO focal objects, operating in subsidiary awareness while focusing on something else.
  
  However, scholars have noted significant divergence between Polanyi's philosophy and Nonaka's organizational adaptation. Eric Straw (Polanyi Society, 2016) argues that "Nonaka's understanding of Polanyi's epistemology was wrong"—Polanyi saw knowledge as an "act of knowing based on indwelling," not merely a classification scheme dividing knowledge into articulable and non-articulable categories. Nonaka later acknowledged this divergence, writing with von Krogh in 2009 that "the concept of tacit knowledge was inspired by but not restricted to Polanyi's work."
  
  Within the SECI spiral, externalization occupies a pivotal position. It receives tacit knowledge built through socialization (shared experience among individuals), transforms it into explicit concepts, and feeds these into the combination phase where explicit knowledge is systematized. Nonaka considered externalization the most critical conversion because it creates genuinely new explicit concepts—whereas socialization and combination merely transfer knowledge of the same type. The spiral metaphor reflects how knowledge amplifies through ontological levels: from individual to group to organization to inter-organizational networks.
- ## Metaphors and dialogue form the cognitive machinery of externalization
  
  The mechanisms by which tacit knowledge becomes explicit follow a **sequential progression from metaphor to analogy to model**. Nonaka described this in his 1991 *Harvard Business Review* article: "First, by linking contradictory things and ideas through metaphor; then, by resolving these contradictions through analogy; and, finally, by crystallizing the created concepts and embodying them in a model."
  
  Metaphor serves as the foundation because it enables individuals to visualize concepts that cannot be directly expressed. It appeals to intuition rather than analysis, connecting imaginatively with intended audiences by transcending specific contexts. Analogy then resolves contradictions created by metaphor, building more structured understanding. Finally, models crystallize concepts into systematic, transmittable knowledge—product specifications, procedures, documented processes.
  
  The canonical example is Honda's development of the City car. Project leader Hiroo Watanabe articulated the metaphor "Theory of Automobile Evolution," comparing a car to a living organism and asking how it should evolve. Through team dialogue, this evolved into "man-maximum, machine-minimum"—maximizing passenger space while minimizing footprint. This crystallized into the "sphere" concept, ultimately producing the distinctive "Tall Boy" design. As Nonaka emphasized, the development team "discussed what Watanabe's slogan might possibly mean before coming up with a metaphor of its own"—demonstrating how knowledge amplifies through collective reflection.
  
  Dialogue is the essential social mechanism enabling externalization. Nonaka and Konno (1998) introduced the concept of **"ba" (場)—a shared space for emerging relationships** that provides "a platform for advancing individual and/or collective knowledge." Ba can be physical (meeting rooms), virtual (digital platforms), mental (shared experiences and ideals), or any combination. Four types of ba correspond to each SECI mode:
- **Originating Ba** supports socialization through face-to-face individual interaction
- **Dialoguing Ba** supports externalization through collective face-to-face interaction
- **Systemising Ba** supports combination through collective virtual interaction
- **Exercising Ba** supports internalization through individual virtual interaction
  
  Dialoguing Ba requires **consciously selecting people with the right mix of knowledge and capabilities**. In this space, individuals share mental models while reflecting on their own, converting tacit knowledge into common terms and concepts. Seven-Eleven Japan reportedly spent $18 million annually on travel and lodging specifically to enable face-to-face dialoguing ba between field counselors and store personnel.
- ## Deeply tacit knowledge resists articulation and conversion loses fidelity
  
  Externalization faces fundamental barriers rooted in the nature of tacit knowledge itself. Building on Polanyi, Grimen identified a "Strong Thesis of Tacit Knowledge"—knowledge that is **in principle verbally unarticulatable** because a logical gap exists between our capacity for cognition and our capacity for articulation.
  
  Several categories of knowledge prove particularly resistant to externalization. **Embodied knowledge**—physical and motor skills like riding a bicycle, playing piano, or the craftsperson's feel for materials—exists in bodily practice and transfers poorly to explicit form. Matsudaira and Fujinami (2009) emphasize that "important in organisational knowledge creation is embodied knowledge of organisations, which has a bearing on problem-finding before any problem-solving." **Emotional and intuitive knowledge** represents another category, as intuition and sense of value cannot be easily externalized but remain essential for organizational decision-making. The **cognitive dimension of tacit knowledge**—mental models, schemata, paradigms, beliefs, viewpoints—"cannot be articulated very easily, because these implicit models shape the way we perceive the world."
  
  Context-dependency creates additional challenges. "For tacit knowledge with high contextual level, there is a risk of loss of context due to codification," Nonaka and Takeuchi acknowledged. Face recognition illustrates this: one can recognize a face among millions yet usually cannot articulate how. Li and Gao (2003) argue for distinguishing implicit knowledge (hidden but potentially articulable) from genuine tacit knowledge (feelings, emotions, intuition, individual behavior) that "cannot be made visible or transferred."
  
  The conversion process itself introduces **fidelity loss**. Codification inherently reduces knowledge richness—context disappears, tacitness (which is "a property of the knower") varies between individuals, and what emerges may better be called semantic information than knowledge. Stephen Gourlay (2003, 2006) critiqued Nonaka's theory as potentially "a Theory of Semantic Information" rather than knowledge creation, arguing that "the empirical basis for the model is highly unsatisfactory" and that process validation requires validation of processes, not simply content.
  
  Other scholars have raised cultural transferability concerns. The SECI model emerged from studies of Japanese companies in the 1980s and 1990s, with employees often serving a company for life in a collectivist culture of "giri" (unconditional obligation to protect relationships). Glisby and Holden (2003) question whether SECI principles apply universally across cultures. Farnese et al. (2019) note that despite wide diffusion, "theoretical development has not always been accompanied by sound methodologies for documenting empirically how the model works in practice."
- ## The knowledge spiral amplifies learning across organizational levels
  
  Externalization's organizational significance lies in its role within the continuous knowledge spiral. Unlike sequential linear models, SECI represents **exponential and dynamic interaction** where knowledge amplifies through ontological levels—from individual to group to organization to inter-organizational networks. When knowledge reaches internalization, tacit knowledge is enriched and the spiral begins again at a higher level.
  
  Externalization produces **organizational memory**—"crystallized knowledge" that preserves "behaviors, mental maps, norms, and values over time" even as members come and go. This memory becomes the foundation for innovation. Research by Byosiere and Luethge (2008) and Bratianu (2010) suggests that conversion modes substantially transforming knowledge quality (externalization and internalization) are "more strictly related to innovation outcomes" than socialization and combination, which may better be conceived as knowledge transfer rather than creation processes.
  
  Organizations must support all four modes simultaneously; attention to externalization alone causes the cycle to "deflate or stop." Nonaka et al. (2000) identified conditions that energize ba: **autonomy** (increasing chances of finding valuable information), **creative chaos** (challenges encouraging boundary transcendence), **redundancy** (intentional overlap promoting tacit knowledge sharing), **requisite variety** (internal diversity matching environmental complexity), and **love, care, trust and commitment** (foundation for knowledge sharing and self-transcendence).
- ## Computational systems and AI extend externalization into new domains
  
  The SECI model has been adapted to computational contexts through several frameworks, with particularly significant developments in 2024-2025 addressing generative AI integration. The **HAC-SECI Model** (Human-AI-Collaboration SECI Model) by Matsumoto, Nishikawa, and Morimoto (2025) proposes a dual-loop structure: an inner "Agent Growth Loop" where humans provide knowledge to LLM-based agents, and an outer "Target Development Loop" where AI helps humans recognize their own knowledge through digital twin interactions.
  
  The **GRAI Framework** (Generative, Receptive AI) by Böhm and Durst (2025) in *VINE Journal of Information and Knowledge Management Systems* represents the most comprehensive extension. It splits SECI's four quadrants into human and machine perspectives, creating **eight fields of action**. The framework positions machines as either active (generating output) or passive (listening and adapting internal representations). GenAI operates primarily in the Combination phase through advanced computations on datasets, but can also assist externalization by creating visual representations and developing conceptual models capturing tacit knowledge structure—though it "still fails to provide concise explanations or references unlike symbolic KM systems."
  
  Earlier work established computational foundations. Hashimoto et al. (2015) developed multi-agent simulations directly based on the SECI model, representing knowledge complexity through bit tags and simulating knowledge propagation across worker and knowledge manager agents. Springer's *Discover Artificial Intelligence* (2022) proposed methodologies where human experts and virtual agents collaborate using domain ontologies and Operational Knowledge Graphs for Industry 4.0 tacit knowledge capture.
  
  For AI memory architectures, research identifies vector databases as essential for semantic search (supporting Combination), while object stores provide scalable, auditable knowledge storage. Knowledge agents combine structured data (JSON, YAML), semi-structured data (wikis, runbooks), and unstructured data (policies, guides) into what mirrors "a senior employee's mental toolkit, but structured for machine consumption."
  
  Empirical studies of ChatGPT integration with SECI in educational settings (Heliyon, 2025) found that **64% of students achieved "excellent" externalization performance** with ChatGPT assistance versus 15% in control groups—demonstrating AI's facilitation of idea generation and mind mapping. However, ChatGPT showed limited impact on Combination and actually decreased predictive power for Internalization from 63.4% to 41.3%, suggesting AI excels at early externalization phases but struggles with deeper knowledge consolidation.
- ## Conclusion: Externalization remains the critical but constrained knowledge bridge
  
  Externalization occupies a unique position in knowledge management theory as the mechanism transforming personal insight into organizational capability. Its theoretical foundations in Polanyi's philosophy, though adapted beyond Polanyi's original intent, provide robust epistemological grounding. The practical mechanisms—metaphor, analogy, model, dialogue within appropriate ba—offer actionable approaches for organizations seeking to capture tacit knowledge.
  
  Yet externalization's constraints prove as instructive as its capabilities. Embodied, emotional, and deeply contextual knowledge will always resist full articulation; conversion inevitably sacrifices some fidelity; and cultural contexts shape how effectively externalization practices transfer. The emerging AI applications reveal a telling pattern: generative AI accelerates externalization's early phases but struggles precisely where humans excel—in the deep internalization that completes and enriches the knowledge spiral. This asymmetry suggests that the future of organizational knowledge creation lies not in AI replacing human externalization but in **human-AI collaborative systems** where AI amplifies articulation while humans provide the embodied judgment, contextual sensitivity, and meaning-making that remain stubbornly, productively tacit.
