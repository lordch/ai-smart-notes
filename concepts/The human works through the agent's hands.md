core-claim:: Delegated execution with retained responsibility. Not alongside, not replaced — through. The human remains accountable; the agent performs actions the human has shaped.

- The useful frame for human-agent collaboration isn't "human alongside agent" or "human replaced by agent." It's *human doing something with agent's hands*.
- This is delegated execution with retained responsibility. The human remains accountable for outcomes. The agent performs actions the human has shaped, directed, and can interrupt. The human hasn't stepped back — they've changed *what* they do, not *whether* they're involved.
- ## The collaboration loop
	- 1. Human identifies problem
	- 2. Agent researches, proposes approaches
	- 3. Agent performs work under human supervision
	- 4. Human refines based on results
	- 5. Knowledge base updates
	- 6. If pattern becomes reliable, human moves up one abstraction level
	- 7. Repeat at new level
- ## How this differs from automation
	- Automation removes the human from the loop. Here the human stays in the loop but operates at a different point. The agent has hands; the human has judgment about where to point them.
- ## The "worker" analogy
	- You built the system, you're responsible for its outputs, you supervise by feel developed through practice, you fix things when they break. The agent doesn't have independent agency — it has delegated agency bounded by context you provide.
- ## What you're selling
	- This framing changes what you're selling when you implement these systems:
		- **Not**: "here's an agent that does your job"
		- **Rather**: "here's infrastructure for working through agents" — organizing knowledge, dividing work into intermediate steps, designing mechanisms for knowledge saving and retrieval

	- **Michał (own articulation)** — "Human does something with agent's hands." Critique of automation framing. Trust and responsibility: "I built the agent, I'm ultimately responsible."
	- **Boundaryml** — "I haven't opened a non-markdown file in an editor in over a month." Human works at research/planning layer; agent works at code layer.
	- **Noah Brier** — Thinking partner sub-agent. Human thinking happens; agent facilitates and captures.
	- **Artem Zhutov** — Morning routine: Claude guides through structured questions. Human answers; agent structures the process.
	- **Darren** — "Fire and forget but come back." The "touch" is reviewing and giving feedback.
